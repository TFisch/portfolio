      <h1>Hello, again!</h1>
      <h2>Allow Me To Spin A Little Yarn...</h2>
      <p>
        Recalling back to when I graduated highschool (2007) and throughout the
        early years of my career, I struggled to find out what I really wanted
        to do. I earned a Bachelor's Degree, made some great money in the
        hospitality and craft beer industries, but I never found that job where
        I could say "Now, this is what I want to do for the rest of my life!"
      </p>
      <h2>Where did You Go to School?</h2>
      <p>
        I was just getting to that. I took my undergraduate at the University of
        Missouri Columbia(2012). I received a bachelor's degree in Arts and
        Sciences. I was an English Major with a History Minor. My emphasis was
        in Creative Writing, one of my greatest passions.
      </p>
      <h2>So Wait, Where did You Learn To Code?</h2>
      <p>
        Fast forward to 2017. I'm living in Denver, Colorado. I've been working
        in the service industry for 5+ years. I'm the General Manager of a craft
        beer brewery and I'm burnt out. Exhausted from the long hours and
        juggling act of responsibilities, I knew I was ready for a change.
      </p>
      <p>*Enter the Turing School of Software and Design*</p>
      <p>
        I heard about a school in Denver that took people who had little to no
        programing experience and turned them into job ready coding machines.
